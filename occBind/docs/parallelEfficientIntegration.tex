\title{Exploiting special features of a new series representation for non-linear stochastic dynamic models}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Anderson has developed a new series representation useful for
solving a wide class of nonlinear dynamic stochastic models.
The solutions computed by the technique accommodate the possibility that 
model trajectories can depart from and re-engage
occasionally binding constraints as well as transition between various regimes. Remarkably, this series representation makes it possible to characterize model solutions as a linear sum of orthogonal functions.  

This presentation reports on the efficiency gains associated with exploiting this linearity and with parallelizing the
computation of the function approximations.
