This paper shows how to apply the formulae in\citep{anderson10} to compute 
rational expectations solutions for models linear except for occasionally binding constraints.  The formulae facilitate the recursive 
computation of solutions that honor the 
constraints for successively 
longer horizons. The solutions thus computed
accommodate the possibility that model
trajectories may depart from and re-engage the constraints.
The technique is applicable for nonlinear inequality constraints.
