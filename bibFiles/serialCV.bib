  abstract={One of the most widely used standard procedures for model
    evaluation in classification and regression is K-fold
    cross-validation (CV). However, when it comes to time series forecasting,
    because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity
    of the data, its application is not straightforward and often omitted by
    practitioners in favor of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. In this paper,
    we show that the particular setup in which time series forecasting is
    usually performed using Machine Learning methods renders the use of
    standard K-fold CV possible. We present theoretical insights supporting
    our arguments. Furthermore, we present a simulation study where we show
    empirically that K-fold CV performs favourably compared to both OOS
    evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as
    non-dependent cross-validation.},
