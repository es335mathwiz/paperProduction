     Sukhanov's variable initial value method for boundary value
     problems, and nonlinear integral equations. Most examples

     to compute the derivatives required by a method, but no

     sensitivity analysis and numerical optimization.
     For simple functions, symbolic differentiation---done either manu

     whereas divided differences (DD) have been used traditionally for
     functions defined by (potentially very complex) computer programs

     even if only approximate values can be obtained this way.
     An alternative approach for such functions is automatic different
     iation
     (AD), yielding exact derivatives at often lower cost than DD, and
     without restrictions on the program complexity.
     In this paper we compare the functionality and describe the use o
     f
     ADMIT/ADMAT and ADiMat.
     These two AD tools provide derivatives for programs written in th

The events surrounding some of the key developments of the past are described along with a discussion of the present state of the research and of paths for future research. The paper is structured around the primary methods for solving quadratic-linear economic stochastic control models, namely open loop, classical control, handcrafted feedback rules, optimal feedback, min-max control, optimal feedback rules with parameter uncertainty and dual control. The paper also includes a discussion of software developments in economic stochastic control modeling.},

The main theoretical result is that reputational and nonreputational policies are certainty-equivalent, as has previously been conjectured, and it is also shown that the welfare loss does not necessarily increase with decreasing information. Of particular additional interest in the analysis of reputational policy design is the issue of sustainability, and it is shown using an example that weak sustainability may be information-dependent.},

There are several different types of software: (1) true programming languages which are used for many purposes in communicating with the machine, such as FORTRAN; (2) software with greater specificity in purpose and function such as MATHEMATICA, GAUSS, MATLAB and MAPLE; (3) "libraries" or collections of special purpose algorithms designed to be used within programs written in one of the major languages, e.g., the LINPACK, MINPACK, EISPAC, and IMSL libraries; (4) Collections of programs, sometimes called packages, linked together and designed for special purposes--these generally must be used within some of the languages one step removed from the basics. Examples include MATLAB Toolboxes; and (5) finally, there are programs which although made generally available cannot be used stand-alone in any sense.},

	pages=321,
	note={IL: 1 chart, 2 diagrams, 1 graph},
	abstract={This paper examines the issue of modelling languages as software tools for the construction and analysis of economic models. Modelling languages are intermediate level software tools that fit between the conventional commercial programming languages (such as C++ and Java) and the higher level applications packages (such as specific econometric packages). They try to blend the advantages of both the higher level and lower level tools. This paper examines these languages for use in the construction of economic models. Specifically, it examines the issue of whether such a language is the appropriate software tool for an economic modeller. It uses the modelling language MATLAB together with a number of illustrative examples to examine the use of these software tools with dynamic economic models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract={The forecast evaluation literature has traditionally focused on methods of assessing point forecasts. However, in the context of many models of financial risk, interest centers on more than just a single point of the forecast distribution. For example, value-at-risk models that are currently in extremely wide use form interval forecasts. Many other important financial calculations also involve estimates not summarized by a point forecast. Although some techniques are currently available for assessing interval and density forecasts, existing methods tend to display low power in sample sizes typically available. This article suggests a new approach to evaluating such forecasts. It requires evaluation of the entire forecast distribution, rather than a scalar or interval. The information content of forecast distributions combined with ex post realizations is enough to construct a powerful test even with sample sizes as small as 100.},

	abstract={We study different solutions to a simple one-dimensional linear quadratic game with a large number of private agents and a government. A "time-consistent" solution is defined as a solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, i.e. as a policy for which the government has no-precommitment capability. This solution is compared to a policy where the government has an "instantaneous" pre-commitment, i.e. an equilibrium in which the government has a period by period leadership. In both cases, we show how control theory should be applied to calculate the equilibrium and how to relate these equilibria to the differential game literature., \cohen},

We show that there is a unique stable solution under two requirements: (i) the determinantal polynomial |Az-B| is not zero for some value of z, and (ii) a rank condition. The unique solution is characterized using a familiar approach: a canonical variables transformation separating dynamics associated with stable and unstable eigenvalues. In singular models, however, there are new canonical variables associated with infinite eigenvalues. These arise from nonexpectational behavioral relations or dynamic identities present in the singular linear difference system.},

In this paper we propose a distributed knowledge management framework for semantics and knowledge creation,
population, and reuse on the grid. Its objective is to evolve the Grid toward the Semantic Grid with the
ultimate purpose of facilitating problem solving in e-Science. The framework uses ontology as the conceptual backbone
and adopts the service-oriented computing paradigm for information- and knowledge-level computation. We
further present a semantics-based approach to problem solving, which exploits the rich semantic information of
grid resource descriptions for resource discovery, instantiation, and composition. The framework and approach has
been applied to a UK e-Science project?Grid Enabled Engineering Design Search and Optimisation in Engineering
(GEODISE). An ontology-enabled problem solving environment (PSE) has been developed in GEODISE to
leverage the semantic content of GEODISE resources and the Semantic Grid infrastructure for engineering design.
Implementation and initial experimental results are reported.

We present an approach to automated classification of clinical

based on supervised learning. The hierarchical structure of the
concepts is exploited, in the training stage, in order to overcome
the low number of training examples. The classification task is
broken into a set of intermediate classifications, throughout the
hierarchy. We use a vector-space representation in order to represent
each guideline and the hierarchical concepts; classification
is based on applying a similarity function at each level. Several
evaluation measures are suggested, based on the intended
use of the hierarchy; these measures correspond to different parameters
of the classification algorithm. Preliminary results are
encouraging; a formal evaluation, including multiple training
methods and evaluation measures, has been performed.

The approximation is in the neighborhood of the linear regulator problem which has a
well-defined solution procedure. The first order perturbation of the optimal decision under
experimentation is a combination of the linear regulator solution and a term that captures
the impact of the uncertainty on the agent's value function. An algorithm is developed
to quickly implement this procedure on the computer. As a result, the impact of optimal
experimentation on an agent's decisions can be quantified and estimated for a large class
of problems encountered in economics.

The primary advantage of higher-order (as opposed to first- or secondorder)
approximations is that they are valid not just locally, but
globally (i.e., over nonlocal, possibly very large compact sets in a
rigorous sense that we specify). We apply our routines to compute
first- through seventh-order approximate solutions to two standard
macroeconomic models, a stochastic growth model and a life-cycle
consumption model, and discuss the quality and global properties of
these solutions.

inflation-indexed security and a portfolio of STRIPS that has similar liquidity and
duration as the indexed security. This measure can be used as a proxy for inflation
expectations if the inflation risk premium is small. The calculated measure suggests
that the rate of inflation expected over the next ten years fell from just under 3% in
mid-1997 to just under 1 ¾% by early 1999, before rising back to about 2 ½% by the
beginning of 2000. This variation is more extensive than would have been expected
from a simple model of inflation dynamics or from a survey measure of long-run
inflation expectations.

abstract= {Nonlinear filtering is the process of estimating and tracking the state of a nonlinear stochastic system from non-Gaussian noisy observation data. In this technical memorandum, we present an overview of techniques for nonlinear filtering for a wide variety of conditions on the nonlinearities and on the noise. We begin with the development of a general Bayesian approach to filtering which is applicable to all linear or nonlinear stochastic systems. We show how Bayesian filtering requires integration over probability density functions that cannot be accomplished in closed form for the general nonlinear, non-Gaussian multivariate system, so approximations are required. Next, we address the special case where both the dynamic and observation models are nonlinear but the noises are additive and Gaussian. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the standard technique usually applied here. But, for severe nonlinearities, the EKF can be very unstable and performs poorly. We show how to use the analytical expression for Gaussian densities to generate integral expressions for the mean and covariance matrices needed for the Kalman filter which include the nonlinearities directly inside the integrals. Several numerical techniques are presented that give approximate solutions for these integrals, including Gauss-Hermite quadrature, unscented filter, and Monte Carlo approximations. We then show how these numerically generated integral solutions can be used in a Kalman filter so as to avoid the direct evaluation of the Jacobian matrix associated with the extended Kalman filter. For all filters, step-by-step block diagrams are used to illustrate the recursive implementation of each filter. To solve the fully nonlinear case, when the noise may be non-additive or non-Gaussian, we present several versions of particle filters that use importance sampling. Particle filters can be subdivided into two categories: those that re-use particles and require resampling to prevent divergence, and those that do not re-use particles and therefore require no resampling. For the first category, we show how the use of importance sampling, combined with particle re-use at each iteration, leads to the sequential importance sampling (SIS) particle filter and its special case, the bootstrap particle filter. The requirement for resampling is outlined and an efficient resampling scheme is presented. For the second class, we discuss a generic importance sampling particle filter and then add specific implementations, including the Gaussian particle filter and combination particle filters that bring together the Gaussian particle filter, and either the Gauss-Hermite, unscented, or Monte Carlo Kalman filters developed above to specify a Gaussian importance density. When either the dynamic or observation models are linear, we show how the Rao-Blackwell simplifications can be applied to any of the filters presented to reduce computational costs. We then present results for two nonlinear tracking examples, one with additive Gaussian noise and one with non-Gaussian embedded noise. For each example, we apply the appropriate nonlinear filters and compare performance results.

MONETARY AND ECONOMIC STUDIES (SPECIAL EDITION)/FEBRUARY 2001
We explore methods for confronting model misspecification in
macroeconomics. We construct dynamic equilibria in which private
agents and policy makers recognize that models are approximations.
We explore two generalizations of rational expectations equilibria.
In one of these equilibria, decision makers use dynamic evolution
equations that are imperfect statistical approximations, and in the
other misspecification is impossible to detect even from infinite
samples of time-series data. In the first of these equilibria, decision
rules are tailored to be robust to the allowable statistical discrepancies.
Using frequency domain methods, we show that robust
decision makers treat model misspecification like time-series
econometricians.
Key words: Robustness; Model misspecification; Monetary policy;
Rational expectations

Adaptive Learning and Business Cycles
(Preliminary and Incomplete)
Noah Williams
Department of Economics, Princeton University and NBER
E-mail: noahw at princeton.edu
Revised January 9, 2003
This paper analyzes the quantitative importance of adaptive learning in business
cycle fluctuations. We first introduce adaptive learning in a real business cycle
model and a New Keynesian model, using specifications drawn from the literature
which assume that agents learn about the equilibrium laws of motion. We consider a
variety of learning rules, and find that in both environments learning has very minor
effects on the volatility and the persistence of the key economic variables. However
we discuss some potential theoretical drawbacks to this formulation of learning, and
consider an alternative formulation in which agents learn about the structural features
of the economy. In some simplified settings, we show that structural learning
has much greater effects. We also illustrate how learning with misspecified beliefs
can lead to fluctuations of a different kind, as agents "escape" from an equilibrium.
Overall, our results show that the importance of learning depends greatly on the
specification of beliefs.

IMPACTS OF PRIORS ON CONVERGENCE AND ESCAPES FROM
NASH INFLATION
THOMAS J. SARGENT AND NOAH WILLIAMS
Abstract. Recent papers have analyzed how economies with adaptive agents may con-
verge to and escape from self-confirming equilibria. These papers have imputed to agents
a particular prior about drifting coefficients. In the context of a model of monetary pol-
icy, this paper analyzes dynamics that govern both convergence and escape under a
more general class of priors for the government. We characterize how the shape of the
prior influences possible cycles, convergence, and escapes. There are priors for which
the E-stability condition is not enough to assure local convergence to a self-confirming
equilibrium. Our analysis also isolates the source of differences in the sustainability of
Ramsey inflation encountered in the analyses of Sims (1988) and Chung (1990), on the
one hand, and Cho, Williams, and Sargent (2002), on the other.
Key Words: Self-confirming equilibrium, mean dynamics, escape route,
large deviation, natural rate of unemployment, adaptation, priors.

Model Uncertainty and Endogenous Volatility
William A. Branch
University of California, Irvine
George W. Evans
University of Oregon
December 9, 2004
Preliminary
Abstract
This paper introduces model uncertainty into a simple Lucas-type monetary
model. Inflation depends on agents' expectations and a vector of exogenous
random variables. Following (Branch and Evans 2004) agents are assumed to
underparameterize their forecasting models. A Misspecification Equilibrium
arises when beliefs are optimal given the misspecification and predictor proportions
are based on relative forecast performance. We show that there may
exist multiple Misspecification Equilibria, a subset of which are stable under
least squares learning and dynamic predictor selection. Using this as a basis,
we identify two channels through which the economy can generate endogenous
inflation and output volatility, an empirical regularity. The dual channels of
least squares parameter updating and dynamic predictor selection combine to
generate regime switching and endogenous volatility.
JEL Classifications: C53; C62; D83; D84; E40
Key Words: Lucas model, model uncertainty, adaptive learning, rational
expectations, volatility.

NOVEL WEB-BASED MODULES FOR A
COURSE IN NUMERICAL METHODS
Web based resources are being developed, assessed and disseminated for a
typical undergraduate course in Numerical Methods. These resources are
holistic, that is, they include pre-requisite information, real-life applications,
presentations and textbook notes, simulations, and self-assessment. The
student interest and learning are maximized by providing customization of
content based on a student's engineering major and computational system of
choice. The effectiveness of the resources was measured via two mixed
assessment instruments ? student satisfaction survey and student
performance. Statistical analysis of the assessment data indicates that webbased
modules for instruction improved both student satisfaction and
performance.

RDFS(FA): A DL-ised Sub-language of RDFS
Jeff Z. Pan and Ian Horrocks
Department of Computer Science
University of Manchester
Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, UK

Abstract
Description Logics (DLs), as a field of research, form a formal foundation of
first-order semanticWeb ontology languages, such as DAML+OIL and OWL. The
Semantic Web will build on XML's ability to define customized tagging schemes
and RDF(S)'s flexible approach to representing data. RDF Schema (RDFS), however,
has a non-standard metamodeling architecture, which makes some elements
in the model have dual roles in the RDFS specification. As a result, the specification
of its semantics requires a non-standard model theory, RDF MT. This leads
to semantic problems when trying to layer DL-based and other conventional firstorder
Web ontology languages on top of RDFS. In this paper we suggest layering
Web ontology languages on top of RDFS(FA), a sub-language of RDFS, which is
based on a (relatively) standard model-theoretic semantics. We will also compare
this approach with the existing RDF Model Theory and show how their semantics
relate to the semantics of OWL, a newly developed Web ontology language by
W3C.

Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy in a
Medium-Scale Macroeconomic Model
Stephanie Schmitt-Groh´e? Mart´in Uribe?
May 27, 2005
Abstract
In this paper, we study Ramsey-optimal fiscal and monetary policy in a mediumscale
model of the U.S. business cycle. The model features a rich array of real and
nominal rigidities that have been identified in the recent empirical literature as salient
in explaining observed aggregate fluctuations. The main result of the paper is that
price stability appears to be a central goal of optimal monetary policy. The optimal
rate of inflation under an income tax regime is half a percent per year with a volatility
of 1.1 percent. This result is surprising given that the model features a number
of frictions that in isolation would call for a volatile rate of inflation?particularly
nonstate-contingent nominal public debt, no lump-sum taxes, and sticky wages. Under
an income-tax regime, the optimal income tax rate is quite stable, with a mean of 30
percent and a standard deviation of 1.1 percent. Simple monetary and fiscal rules are
shown to implement a competitive equilibrium that mimics well the one induced by the
Ramsey policy. When the fiscal authority is allowed to tax capital and labor income
at different rates, optimal fiscal policy is characterized by a large and volatile subsidy
on capital. JEL Classification: E52, E61, E63.
Keywords: Ramsey Policy, Inflation Stabilization, Tax Smoothing, Time to Tax, Nominal
Rigidities, Real Rigidities.

A Framework for Understanding and Classifying
Ontology Applications
Robert Jasper and Mike Uschold
Boeing Math and Computing Technology, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, USA
Abstract
For1 ontologies to be cost-effectively deployed, we require a clear understanding of the various ways that ontologies
are being used today. To achieve this end, we present a framework for understanding and classifying ontology
applications. We identify four main categories of ontology applications: 1) neutral authoring, 2) ontology as specification,
3) common access to information, and 4) ontology-based search. In each category, we identify specific
ontology application scenarios. For each, we indicate their intended purpose, the role of the ontology, the supporting
technologies, who the principal actors are and what they do. We illuminate the similarities and differences between
scenarios.
We draw on work from other communities, such as software developers and standards organizations. We use a
relatively broad definition of 'ontology', to show that much of the work being done by those communities may be
viewed as practical applications of ontologies. The common thread is the need for sharing the meaning of terms in a
given domain, which is a central role of ontologies. An additional aim of this paper is to draw attention to common
goals and supporting technologies of these relatively distinct communities to facilitate closer cooperation and faster
progress2.

Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology
Reference: Noy, N. F. & McGuinness, D. L. Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology. Knowledge Systems Laboratory, March, 2001. 

Abstract: Ontologies have become core components of many large applications yet the training material has not kept pace with the growing interest. This paper addresses the issues of why one would build an ontology and presents a methodology for creating ontologies based on declarative knowledge representation systems. It leverages the two authors experiences building and maintaining ontologies in a number of ontology environments including Protege-2000, Ontolingua, and Chimaera. It presents the methodology by example utilizing a tutorial wines knowledge base example. While it is aimed at users of frame-based systems, it can be useful for building ontologies in any object-centered system.

AT&T Bell Laboratories
Murray Hill, NJ 07974
ABSTRACT
The MetaPost system implements a picture-drawing language very much like Knuth's METAFONT
except that it outputs PostScript commands instead of run-length-encoded bitmaps. MetaPost is
a powerful language for producing figures for documents to be printed on PostScript printers. It
provides easy access to all the features of PostScript and it includes facilities for integrating text
and graphics.
This document serves as an introductory user's manual. It does not require knowledge of META-
FONT or access to The METAFONTbook, but both are beneficial. An appendix explains the differences
between MetaPost and METAFONT.

Abstract
Fast lookups are crucial to many computer applications and operations. The general problem of indexing and
searching on arbitrary data is not a simple one, with many semantic, linguistic, and technical issues to iron out. In
this paper we present swish-e, a descendent of Kevin Hughes' SWISH project from 1994. Swish-e provides a fullfeatured
and useful toolkit to index and query 8-bit ASCII data. This paper discusses the structure, features, and
usage of swish-e, with mentions of possible directions for further development and interesting related work. We also
compare swish-e to MySQL's full-text search feature in terms of features and speed, and discuss two real-world
swish-e applications, Sman and Swished

},
  note = 	 {JEL Classifications: C6, E5},
abstract ={
In recent years, the learnability of rational expectations equilibria (REE) and determinacy
of economic structures have rightfully joined the usual performance criteria
among the sought after goals of policy design. Some contributions to the literature,
including Bullard and Mitra (2001) and Evans and Honkapohja (2002), have made significant
headway in establishing certain features of monetary policy rules that facilitate
learning. However a treatment of policy design for learnability in worlds where agents
have potentially misspecified their learning models has yet to surface. This paper provides
such a treatment. We begin with the notion that because the profession has yet to
settle on a consensus model of the economy, it is unreasonable to expect private agents
to have collective rational expectations. We go further in assuming that agents have
only an approximate understanding of the workings of the economy and that their task
of learning true reduced forms of the economy is subject to potentially destabilizing
errors. The issue is then whether a central bank can design policy to account for errors
in learning and still assure the learnability of the model. Our test case is the standard
New Keynesian business cycle model. For different parameterizations of a given policy
rule, we use structured singular value analysis (from robust control theory) to find the
largest ranges of misspecifications that can be tolerated in a learning model without
compromising convergence to an REE.
In addition, we study the cost, in terms of performance in the steady state of a
central bank that acts to robustify learnability on the transition path to REE.

Coordination on Saddle-Path Solutions: The Eductive Viewpoint -- Linear Multivariate Models

University of Oregon Economics Department Working Papers from University of Oregon Economics Department 

Abstract: We examine local strong rationality (LSR) in multivariate models with both forward-looking expectations and predetermined variables. Given hypothetical common knowledge restrictions that the dynamics will be close to those of a specified minimal state variable solution, we obtain eductive stability conditions for the solution to be LSR. In the saddlepoint stable case the saddle-path solution is LSR provided the model is structurally homogeneous across agents. However, the eductive stability conditions are strictly more demanding when heterogeneity is present, as can be expected in multisectoral models. Heterogeneity is thus a potentially important source of instability even in the saddlepoint stable case.

E-STABILITY DOES NOT IMPLY LEARNABILITY
Chryssi Giannitsarou*?
Revised February 12, 2004
Abstract. The concept of E-stability is widely used as a learnability criterion in studies
of macroeconomic dynamics with adaptive learning. In this paper, it is demonstrated, via a
counterexample, that E-stability does not in general imply learnability of rational expectations
equilibria. The result indicates that E-stability may not a robust device for equilibrium
selection.

Stability Properties for Learning with Heterogeneous
Expectations and Multiple Equilibria

February 10, 2004
Abstract
This paper examines learning with heterogeneous expectations in a simple macroeconomic
model with multiple equilibria where expectations are formed from heterogeneous forecast
functions. Stability properties of this model are determined by the distribution of heterogeneity.
These results differ greatly from those which impose homogenous expectations a priori.
When the distribution of heterogeneity is allowed to vary, the stability conditions obtained
guarantee that each equilibrium is stationary when it is stable under learning. The central
result is that the two equilibria exchange stability when the MSE of using this simpler
updating rule is minimized.
Key Words: Adaptive Learning; Heterogeneous Expectations; Multiple Equilibria;
Rational Expectations.

UNIVARIATE MODELS

DELTA and Coll`ege de France
We investigate local strong rationality (LSR) in a one-step-forward-looking univariate
model with memory one. Eductive arguments are used to determine when common
knowledge (CK) that the solution is near some perfect-foresight path is sufficient to
trigger complete coordination on that path (i.e., the path is LSR). Coordination of
expectations is shown to depend on three factors: the nature of the CK initial beliefs, the
degree of structural heterogeneity, and the information structure. Our sufficient conditions
for LSR precisely reflect these features and provide basic consistent justifications for the
choice of the saddle-path solution.

Abstract
For a VAR with drifting coefficients and stochastic volatilities, we present posterior densities for
several objects that are pertinent for designing and evaluating monetary policy. These include measures
of inflation persistence, the natural rate of unemployment, a core rate of inflation, and 'activism
coefficients' for monetary policy rules. Our posteriors imply substantial variation of all of these
objects for post WWII US data. After adjusting for changes in volatility, persistence of inflation
increases during the 1970s, then falls in the 1980s and 1990s. Innovation variances change systematically,
being substantially larger in the late 1970s than during other times. Measures of uncertainty
about core inflation and the degree of persistence covary positively.We use our posterior distributions
to evaluate the power of several tests that have been used to test the null hypothesis of time-invariance
of autoregressive coefficients of VARs against the alternative of time-varying coefficients. Except for
one, we find that those tests have low power against the form of time variation captured by our model.

Received 6 July 2004
Available online 19 February 2005
Abstract
We consider inflation and debt dynamics under a global interest rate rule when private agents
forecast using adaptive learning. Given the zero lower bound on interest rates, active interest rate rules
are known to imply the existence of a second, low-inflation steady state. Under learning the economy
can slip below this low-inflation steady state and be driven to an even lower inflation floor supported
by a switch to an aggressive money supply rule. Fiscal policy alone cannot push the economy out of
this liquidity trap. Raising the inflation floor sufficiently can ensure a return to the target equilibrium.

Received 1 September 2004
Available online 19 February 2005
Abstract
This paper estimates a dynamic stochastic equilibrium model in which monetary policy follows a
nominal interest rate rule that is subject to regime switches in the target inflation rate. Two specifications
are considered: agents know the current state of monetary policy (full information) and agents
use Bayesian updating to infer the policy regime (learning). First, our policy regime estimates are
consistent with the view that policy was marked by a shift to a high-inflation regime in the early
1970s which ended with Volcker's stabilization policy. Second, while Bayesian posterior odds favor
the full-information version of the model, the fall of interest rates, actual and expected inflation in the
early 1980s is better captured by the delayed response of the learning specification. Third, monetary
policy shocks of up to two standard deviations essentially do not trigger the Bayesian learning mechanism.
Yet due to nonlinearities, interventions that lead to small initial interest rate changes may be
associated with much larger effects on output and inflation than under full information.

Changing beliefs and the term structure of interest

Received 1 April 2003; revised 1 December 2004
Available online 17 February 2005
Abstract
This paper shows how to estimate a Bayesian VAR with drifting parameters and nonlinear crossequation
restrictions. The restrictions promote parsimony by reducing the dimension of the drifting
component in conditional mean parameters. As an application, the paper investigates an anticipatedutility
version of the expectations model of the term structure. The estimates suggest that changing
beliefs matter for understanding the yield curve and point to an intriguing clue about risk premia.
Local approximations to the mean yield spread are highly correlated with the variance of the trend
short rate, suggesting a connection between uncertainty about the long-run target of monetary policy
and risk premia on long-term bonds.

SHOCKS AND GOVERNMENT BELIEFS:
THE RISE AND FALL OF AMERICAN INFLATION
THOMAS SARGENT, NOAH WILLIAMS, AND TAO ZHA
ABSTRACT. We use a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm jointly to estimate
the parameters of a 'true' data generating mechanism and those of a sequence of approximating
models that a monetary authority uses to guide its decisions. Gaps between a true
expectational Phillips curve and the monetary authority's approximating non-expectational
Phillips curve models unleash inflation that a monetary authority that knows the true model
would avoid. A sequence of dynamic programming problems implies that the monetary
authority's inflation target evolves as its estimated Phillips curve moves. Our estimates attribute
the rise and fall of post WWII inflation in the US to an intricate interaction between
the monetary authority's beliefs and economic shocks. Shocks in the 1970s made the monetary
authority perceive a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment that ignited big
inflation. The monetary authority's beliefs about the Phillips curve changed in ways that
account for Volcker's conquest of US inflation.

FISCAL DETERMINATION OF HYPERINFLATION
(VERY PRELIMINARY)
THOMAS SARGENT, NOAH WILLIAMS, AND TAO ZHA
ABSTRACT. We develop and estimate a nonlinear general equilibrium model on hyperinflation.
Our estimated results show that the recurrence of hyperinflation and the sustained
end of it are determined by the amount of average seigniorage or shocks to seigniorage or
both. A high level of average seigniorage is necessary but not sufficient to cause hyperinflation.
Each country has its distinctive characteristic in its experience with hyperinflation.
Unlike the existing literature on hyperinflation, we show that intricate interactions among
beliefs, escapes, levels of average seigniorage, and sizes of shock variances explain different
dynamic patterns of inflation we observe in different Latin American countries.

Changes in the Federal Reserve's Inflation Target:
Causes and Consequences
Peter N. Ireland
Abstract:
This paper estimates a New Keynesian model to draw inferences about the behavior of the
Federal Reserve's unobserved inflation target. The results indicate that the target rose from 1-
1/4 percent in 1959 to over 8 percent in the mid-to-late 1970s before falling back below 2-1/2
percent in 2004. The results also provide some support for the hypothesis that over the entire
postwar period, Federal Reserve policy has systematically translated short-run price pressures
set off by supply-side shocks into more persistent movements in inflation itself, although
considerable uncertainty remains about the true source of shifts in the inflation target.

Manuscript Region of Origin:
Abstract: Economic models derived from optimizing behaviour are typically characterized by the properties
of non-linearity and saddle-path instability. The typical solution method involves deriving the stable arm of
the saddle-path and calculating suitable "jumps" to bring the path of endogenous variables onto this stable
arm. The solution for the stable arm can be determined using a range of different approaches. In this paper
we examine the extent to which the success of these alternative approaches can be evaluated. Any method
of evaluation will be dependent upon the amount of information that is known about a particular model
solution. For some deterministic models the only information known with certainty about the path of the
model solution are values taken by steady-state solutions; the rest of the path must be approximated in
some way based on numerical solutions derived from non-linear ordinary differential equations. We first
present a standard investment model and a higher-dimensional version of the same model where this is the
case. In some special cases it is possible to derive a closed-form solution of the entire path. As an example
of a model with a closed-form solution, we consider a simple linear model with two stable complex-valued
eigenvalues and one unstable real-valued eigenvalue. The model is then employed as a benchmark to
compare the properties of model solutions derived using two well-known solution algorithms. Because the
entire solution path of the model is known, it is possible to derive deeper insights into the factors that are
likely to ensure the success or failure of different solution approaches than would be the case if less
information about the solution path was available.

An Estimated DSGE Model of the US Economy with an
Application to Natural Rate Measures
Rochelle M. Edge, Michael T. Kiley, and Jean-Philippe Laforte*
Preliminary
November 21, 2005
Abstract
This paper discusses a monetary dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the
US economy. The model is designed to capture the most important production and
expenditures decisions in the US economy while remaining sufficiently small to allow
intuitive storytelling regarding the key drivers of economic fluctuations. We empha-
size the role of model-based analyses as vehicles for storytelling by providing several
examples of how our model provides stories regarding the nature of fluctuations in re-
cent years that are both similar to and quite dissimilar from conventional accounts ?
in particular with regard to the evolution of the natural or efficient rates of produc-
tion and interest. These examples highlight aspects of DSGE models that may benefit
substantially from further research.

ABSTRACT
The timelessly optimal monetary policy proposed by Woodford (2003)
may be dominated by alternative timeless policies. We provide a formal
justification for these alternative policies. We demonstrate why discount rates
do not matter and establish that optimizing over the unconditional expectation
of the policy criterion function recovers these alternative strategies.

These fluctuations include persistent movements in output along with the other defining features of business cycles, like volatile investment and smooth consumption. We assume that prices are exogenously sticky for a short time. Persistent output fluctuations require endogenous price stickiness in the sense that firms choose not to change prices much when they can do so. We find that for a wide range of parameter values, the amount of endogenous stickiness is small. Thus, we find that in a standard quantitative model, staggered price-setting, alone, does not generate business cycle fluctuations.},

It connects this discussion to the debates over fiscal criteria for membership in the EMU.},

     abstract = {The paper is concerned with the role of monetary policy and argues that activist monetary policy can affect the behavior of real output, rational expectations notwithstanding. A rational expectations model with overlapping labor contracts is constructed, with each labor contract being made for two periods. These contracts inject an element of short-run wage stickiness into the model. Because the money stock is changed by the monetary authority more frequently than labor contracts are renegotiated, and, given the assumed form of the labor contracts, monetary policy has the ability to affect the short-run behavior of output, though it has no effects on long-run output behavior.},

 abstract = {This paper studies the econometrics of computed dynamic models. Since these models generally lack a closed-form solution, their policy functions are approximated by numerical methods. Hence, the researcher can only evaluate an approximated likelihood associated with the approximated policy function rather than the exact likelihood implied by the exact policy function. What are the consequences for inference of the use of approximated likelihoods? First, we find conditions under which, as the approximated policy function converges to the exact policy, the approximated likelihood also converges to the exact likelihood. Second, we show that second order approximation errors in the policy function, which almost always are ignored by researchers, have first order effects on the likelihood function. Third, we discuss convergence of Bayesian and classical estimates. Finally, we propose to use a likelihood ratio test as a diagnostic device for problems derived from the use of approximated likelihoods.},

     abstract = {A two-step hybrid perturbation Galerkin technique for solving a variety of applied mathematics problems involving a small parameter is presented. The first step consists of using a regular or singular perturbation method to determine the asymptotic expansion of the solution in terms of the small parameter. Then the approximate solution is assumed to have the form of a sum of perturbation coefficient functions multiplied by (unknown) amplitudes (gauge functions). In the second step the classical Bubnov-Galerkin method is used to determine these amplitudes. The resulting hybrid method has the potential of overcoming some of the drawbacks of the perturbation and Bubnov-Galerkin methods applied separately, while combining some of the good features of both. The proposed method is applied to some singular perturbation problems in slender body theory. The results obtained from the hybrid method are compared with approximate solutions obtained by other methods, and the applicability of the hybrid method to broader problem areas is discussed.},

  abstract = {Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.}

We show the optimal policy rule with the monetary authority loss function as an optimality criterion. We also study changes in the optimal policy rule resulting from the varying degree of forward-lookingness in the model and investigate the nature of the formal relationship between the degree of forward-lookingness of the model and the shape of the optimal monetary policy rule.}}

In this paper we review the literature on social discounting, and address in particular a recently growing field of related research, that is, individual time preferences. We argue that an explicit consideration and analysis of the behaviour of individuals regarding the concept and the use of an appropriate social discount rate are essential for balanced decision making in the public sector, especially, though not exclusively, in the field of resource or environmental policy.},

  abstract = {{Your class library works, but could it be better? \_Refactoring: Improving the
Design of Existing Code\_ shows how refactoring can make object-oriented code
simpler and easier to maintain. Today, refactoring requires considerable
design know-how, but once tools become available, all programmers should be
able to improve their code using refactoring techniques.

Besides an introduction to what refactoring is, this handbook provides a
catalogue of dozens of tips for improving code. The best thing about
\_Refactoring\_ is its remarkably clear presentation, along with excellent nuts-
and-bolts advice, from object expert Martin Fowler. The author is also an
authority on software patterns and UML, and this experience helps make this a
better book, one that should be immediately accessible to any intermediate or
advanced object-oriented developer. (Just like patterns, each refactoring tip
is presented with a simple name, a "motivation," and examples using Java and
UML.)

Early chapters stress the importance of testing in successful refactoring.
(When you improve code, you have to test to verify that it still works.) After
the discussion on how to detect the "smells" of bad code, readers get to the
heart of the book, its catalogue of more than 70 "refactorings"--tips for
better and simpler class design. Each tip is illustrated with "before" and
"after" code, along with an explanation. Later chapters provide a quick look
at refactoring research.

Like software patterns, refactoring may be an idea whose time has come. This
groundbreaking title will surely help bring refactoring to the programming
mainstream. With its clear advice on a hot new topic, \_Refactoring\_ is sure to
be essential reading for anyone who writes or maintains object- oriented
software. --\_Richard Dragan\_

**Topics Covered:** Refactoring, improving software code, redesign, design
tips, patterns, unit testing, refactoring research and tools.}}

It discusses of some of the conceptual and the technical aspects of this literature, and provides a simple framework for illustrating the mechanisms of various dynamic equilibrium models that give rise to indeterminate equilibria. The role of external effects, monopolistic competition, and increasing returns in generating indeterminacy is explored for one-sector and multi-sector models of real business cycles and of economic growth. Indeterminacy is also studied in monetary models, as well as in models where monetary and fiscal policy are endogenous and determined by feedback rules. Particular attention is paid to the empirical plausibility of these models and their parametrizations in generating indeterminate equilibria. An overview of calibrated macroeconomic models with sunspot equilibria is given, and their successes and shortcomings in matching properties of data are assessed. Finally some issues regarding the selection of equilibria, the observable implications, and difficulties of forecasting that arise in such models are briefly addressed.},

Our study is structured on two main sections; the first one presents the importance of money market integration for the common policy and the seconds analyses the transmission mechanism functioning under financial distress. An efficient and integrated money market is essential for a sound monetary policy, given that it provides an even distribution of central bank liquidity and a homogeneous level of short-term interest rates in the entire space of the common currency. If monetary policy transmission mechanism has been irreversibly affected by the international crisis, it is still premature to determine.},

I reconsider the \&quot;bad beta, good beta\&quot; ICAPM proposed by Campbell and Vuolteenaho and I point out that the explanatory power of the model relies on including the stock market crash that opened the Great Depression. When using a Markov-switching VAR, a '30s regime is identified. This regime receives a large weight when forming expectations consistent with the ICAPM, suggesting that the way agents think about financial markets is shaped by what happens during extreme circumstances. From a technical point of view, the paper extends the present value decomposition of Campbell and Shiller to allow for Markov-switching dynamics in the law of motion of the state variables. This approach could shed new light on the sensitivity of the present value decomposition methodology to the sample choice.},

McCallum-Taylor specifications with an interest rate instrument and a nominal income gap target perform better than benchmark Taylor rules in describing monetary policy in inflation targeting economies. Estimating reaction functions for economies operating monetary and exchange rate targeting regimes produces mixed results, often revealing a lean with the wind behaviour. Instrument smoothing is a feature in the monetary base and in the interest rate reaction functions, but the exchange rate is not consistently significant. The results from the econometric analysis are robust to using alternative estimators.},

The first examines the most important crisis and post-crisis problems of Romania. The analysis is developed preponderantly from a structural point of view. The second chapter presents three simulated scenarios for the period 2010-2014. One of them (named the Base Scenario BSc) is conceived with macroeconomic parameters close to those envisaged by Government, in correlation with the IMF stand-by Agreement. The other two (the Worsened Scenarios W1Sc and W2Sc) admit less favorable domestic and external business environment. In the final chapter, the results of simulations are compared to each other and also to the officially accepted forecasting documents. Some former similar predictions (anticipating more optimistic indicators) are discussed from the modeling perspective.},

 abstract = {We develop a projection method that can solve dynamic economic models with a large number of state variables. A distinctive feature of our method is that it operates on the ergodic set realized in equilibrium: we simulate a model, distinguish clusters on simulated series and use the clustersâ centers as a grid for projections. Making the grid endogenous to the model allows us to avoid costs associated with finding a solution in areas of state space that are never visited in equilibrium. On a standard desktop computer, we calculate linear and quadratic solutions to a multi-country growth model with up to 400 and 80 state variables, respectively. Our solutions are global, and their accuracy does not rapidly decline away from steady state.},

  abstract={This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence that supports the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant monetarist arithmetic\&rdquo; that an increase in public debt is typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

This was the motivation for important recent developments in nonlinear congruential methods for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers. It is particularly promising to achieve nonlinearity by employing the operation of multiplicative inversion with respect to a prime modulus. In the present paper a new class of such inversive congruential generators is introduced and analyzed. It is shown that they have excellent statistical independence properties and model true random numbers very closely. The methods of proof rely heavily on Weil-Stepanov bounds for rational exponential sums.},

  abstract={We use a range of data sources to assess if, and to what extent, government redistribution policies have slowed or accelerated the trend towards greater income disparities in the past 20-25 years. In most countries, inequality among ânon-elderlyâ households has widened during most phases of the economic cycle and any episodes of narrowing income differentials have usually not lasted long enough to close the gap between high and low incomes that had opened up previously. With progressive redistribution systems in place, greater inequality automatically leads to more redistribution, even if no policy action is taken. We find that, in the context of rising market-income inequality, tax-benefit systems have indeed become more redistributive since the 1980s but that this did not stop income inequality from rising: market-income inequality grew by twice as much as redistribution. The redistributive strength of tax-benefit systems weakened in many countries particularly in the most recent decade. While growing market-income disparities were the main driver of inequality trends between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, reduced redistribution was often the main driver in the ten years that followed. Benefits had a much stronger impact on inequality than social contributions or taxes, despite the much bigger aggregate size of direct taxes. As a result, redistribution policies were often less successful at counteracting growing income gaps at the bottom in the top half of the income distribution.<BR>Nous utilisons une sÃ©rie de sources de donnÃ©es afin d'Ã©valuer si, et dans quelle mesure, les politiques de redistribution du gouvernement ont ralenti ou accÃ©lÃ©rÃ© la tendance vers une aggravation des disparitÃ©s de revenus dans les 20-25 derniÃ¨res annÃ©es.

  abstract={This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence that supports the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant monetarist arithmetic\&rdquo; that an increase in public debt is typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

Markets are endogenously incomplete due to the fact that the borrowing constraints are determined endogenously. We first show that, if competitive financial intermediaries are allowed to set the borrowing limits, then the ones that prevent default will be an equilibrium outcome. The equilibrium allocations in this economy are not constrained efficient due to the fact that intermediaries do not internalize the adverse effects of capital on default incentives. We also isolate and quantifiy this new source of inefficiency by comparing the competitive equilibrium allocations to the constrained efficient ones both qualitatively and quantitatively. We tend to observe higher capital accumulation in the competitive equilibrium, implying that agents may enjoy higher (average) welfare in the long run than in the constrained efficient allocation.},

  pages={73-127},
  month={June},
  abstract={Recent treatments of the issue of a zero floor on nominal interest rates have been subject to some important methodological limitations. These include the assumption of perfect foresight or the introduction of the zero lower bound as an initial condition or a constraint on the variance of the interest rate, rather than an occasionally binding non-negativity constraint. This paper addresses these issues, offering a global solution to a standard dynamic stochastic sticky-price model with an explicit occasionally binding non-negativity constraint on the nominal interest rate. It turns out that the dynamics and sometimes the unconditional means of the nominal rate, inflation, and the output gap are strongly affected by uncertainty in the presence of the zero lower bound. Commitment to the optimal rule reduces unconditional welfare losses to around one-tenth of those achievable under discretionary policy, while constant price-level targeting delivers losses that are only 60 percent larger than those under the optimal rule. Even though the unconditional performance of simple instrument rules is almost unaffected by the presence of the zero lower bound, conditional on a strong deflationary shock, simple instrument rules perform substantially worse than the optimal policy.},

As a corollary, convergence of an iterative procedure on the Euler equation, usually referred to as time iteration, is ascertained. This procedure turns out to be very convenient from a computational perspective; dynamic economic problems with inequality constraints can be solved reliably and extremely efficiently by exploiting the theoretical insights provided by the paper.},

We argue that in the typical macroeconomic model with valuable leisure, labor function is particularly convenient for parameterizing. This is because under the labor-function parameterization, the intratemporal first-order condition admits a closed-form solution, while under other parameterizations, there should be a numerical solution. In the context of a simulation-based parameterized expectations algorithm, we find that using the labor-function parameterization instead of the standard consumption-function parameterization reduces computational time by more than a factor of 10.

Another good reference for the solution methods used in these programs is the working paper \&quot;Algorithms for Solving Dynamic Models with Occasionally Binding Constraints\&quot; by Larry Christiano and Jonas Fisher. All algorithms have the following properties. 1. They use the tensor method to approximate the conditional expectation with orthogonal Chebyshev polynomials. 2. The coefficients of the approximating function are such that they minimize the distance between the approximating function and the numerically calculated conditional expectation at a set of grid points. 3. The grid points are Chebyshev nodes. 4. The numerical integration procedure used to calculate the conditional expectation is Hermite Gaussian Quadrature. In my experience it is easier to obtain an accurate solution fast with quadrature methods than with Monte Carlo methods. 5. The \&quot;iterative\&quot; programs iterate on a projection procedure to find the coefficients of the approximating function. 6.

The method can be applied to a variety of models, including models with strong nonlinearities, sub-optimal equilibria, and many continuous state variables. In this approach, the conditional expectations in the equilibrium conditions are approximated by finite-dimensional classes of functional forms. The approach is highly efficient computationally because it incorporates endogenous oversampling and Monte-Carlo integration, and it does not impost a discrete grid on the state variables or the stochastic shocks. We prove that PEA can approximate the correct solution with arbitrary accuracy on the ergodic set by increasing the size of the Monte-Carlo simulations and the dimensionality of the approximating family of functions.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

This paperintroduces a method for computing equilibrium of these models by including a distribution directly as a state variable if it is finite-dimensional or a fine approximation of it if infinite-dimensional. The method accurately computes equilibrium in an extreme calibration of Huffman's (1987) overlapping-generations economy where quasi-aggregation, the accurate forecasting of prices using a small state space, fails to obtain. The method also accurately solves for equilibrium in a version of Krusell and Smith's (1998) economy wherein quasi-aggregation obtains but households face occasionally binding constraints. The method is demonstrated to be not only accurate but also feasible with equilibria for both economies being computed in under ten minutes in Matlab. Feasibility is achieved by using Smolyak's (1963) sparse-grid interpolation algorithm to limit the necessary number of gridpoints by many orders of magnitude relative to linear interpolation. Accuracy is achieved by using Smolyak's algorithm, which relies on smoothness, only for representing the distribution and not for other state variables such as individual asset holdings.},

 abstract = {This paper employs a multi-country large scale Overlapping Generations model with uninsurable labor productivity and mortality risk to quantify the impact of the demographic transition towards an older population in industrialized countries on world-wide rates of return, international capital flows and the distribution of wealth and welfare in the OECD. We find that for the U.S. as an open economy, rates of return are predicted to decline by 86 basis points between 2005 and 2080 and wages increase by about 4.1%. If the U.S. were a closed economy, rates of return would decline and wages increase by less. This is due to the fact that other regions in the OECD will age even more rapidly; therefore the U.S. is "importing" the more severe demographic transition from the rest of the OECD in the form of larger factor price changes. In terms of welfare, our model suggests that young agents with little assets and currently low labor productivity gain, up to 1% in consumption, from higher wages associated with population aging. Older, asset-rich households tend to lose, because of the predicted decline in real returns to capital.},

  abstract={ This paper studies the optimal long-run inflation rate (OIR) in a small New Keynesian model, where the only policy instrument is a short-term nominal interest rate that may occasionally run against a zero lower bound (ZLB). The model allows for worst-case scenarios of misspecification. The analysis shows first, if the government optimally commits, the OIR is below 1 percent annually. Second, if the government re-optimizes each period, the OIR rises markedly to 17 percent. Third, if the government commits only to an inertial Taylor rule, the inflation bias is eliminated at very low cost in terms of welfare for the representative household.

  abstract={A DSGE model takes the mathematical form of a system of nonlinear stochastic equations. Except in a very few cases, there is no analytical solution and economists are left using numerical methods in order to obtain approximated solutions. Global approximation methods are available when the state space is not too large, while the most usual approach is local approximation around the deterministic steady state. The perturbation approach introduced in economics by Judd (1996) derives a Taylor expansion of the solution from a Taylor expansion of the original problem, but ?rst order approximation is nothing but linearization that has been used in the RBC literature since its inception. Second order approximations are discussed in several papers: Sims (2000); Collard and Juillard (2001); Kim et al. (2003); Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004). Second order approximations have two merits. In most cases, but not in all, they provide a more accurate approximation of the solution, but, more importantly, they break away from certainty equivalence, that is an inescapable characteristic of linear model. This is crucial to address issues related to attitudes toward risk. There is of course no reason, except size of model, to consider only ?rst or second order approximations. Higher order approximation as also sometimes used: Jin and Judd (2002); Juillard and Kamenik (2004).}}

The focus is the ergodic distribution of welath. This distribution satisfies a Fredholm integral equation. The ergodic distribution can be characterized in some respects by direct analysis of the stochastic process governing wealth accumulation and by use of the Fredholm equation without solution.},

Sufficient conditions are given for the ergodicity of the pair Markov process $\{(x_n,\xi_n); n\ge 0\}$ arising from the nonlinear stochastic difference equation $x_{n+1}=f(x_n,\xi_n)$ on a manifold $M$ and with $f$ being at least a continuous map. An essential condition for ergodicity is the existence of a unique maximal invariant control set $C$ for the associated control system $x_{n+1}=f(x_n,u_n),u_n\in$ supp $(\pi_\xi)$, the support of $\pi_\xi$. It is shown that under some further hypotheses involving compactness and weak stochastic controllability, the set $C\times\text{ supp }(\pi_\xi)$ is Harris recurrent for the pair process $\{(x_n,\xi_n); n\ge 0\}$ and that the invariant measure on $C\times\text{supp}(\pi_\xi)$ is unique and finite. Since geometric control theory is used to prove ergodicity, several results concerning control sets of discrete time dynamical systems are also given.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we present theoretical foundations of main methods solving rational expectations models with a special focus on perturbation approaches. We restrict our attention to models with a finite number of state variables. We first give some insights on the solution methods for linear models. Second, we show how to use the perturbation approach for solving non-linear models. We then document the limits of this approach. The perturbation approach, while it is the most common solution method in the macroeconomic literature, is inappropriate in a context of large fluctuations (large shocks or regime switching) and of strong non-linearities (e.g. occasionally binding constraints). The former case is then illustrated extensively by studying regime switching models. We also illustrate the latter case by studying existing methods for solving rational expectations models under the Zero Lower Bound constraint, i.e. the condition of non negativity of the nominal interest rate. Finally, we end up with a brief presentation of global methods which are alternatives when the perturbation approach fails in solving models.},

Our general framework includes a number of different model features studied in the literature. We propose an efficient methodology for estimating regime-switching DSGE models. The model that best fits the U.S. time-series data is the one with synchronized shifts in shock variances across two regimes and the fit does not rely on strong nominal rigidities. We find little evidence of changes in the inflation target. We identify three types of shocks that account for most of macroeconomic fluctuations: shocks to total factor productivity, wage markup, and the capital depreciation rate.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

However, it has an important shortcoming: it is not a contraction mapping technique and thus, does not guarantee finding the solution. We suggest a simple modification that enhances the convergence property of the algorithm. The idea is to rule out the possibility of (ex)implosive behavior by artificially restricting the simulated series within certain bounds. As the solution is refined along the iterations, the bounds are gradually removed. The modified PEA can systematically converge to the stationary solution starting from the nonstochastic steady state.},

  abstract = {This paper points out an important source of confusion and inefficiency in Smola and
Scholkopf's Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm for SVM regression that is
caused by the use of a single threshold value. Using clues from the KKT conditions for the
dual problem, two threshold parameters are employed to derive modifications of SMO for regression.
These modified algorithms perform significantly faster than the original SMO on the
datasets tried.

  abstract={Guided by topological considerations, a new method is introduced to obtain optimal delay coordinates for data from chaotic dynamic systems. By determining simultaneously the minimal necessary embedding dimension as well as the proper delay time we achieve optimal reconstructions of attractors. This can be demonstrated, e.g. , by reliable dimension estimations from limited data series.}

Details of the procedure to generate the clusters and the sequential schedules were given. The algorithm was assessed by comparing its performance with generalized simulated annealing algorithm in a difficult instructive example and a D-optimum experimental design problem. It is shown the presented algorithm to be more effective and reliable based on the two examples.",

abstract="The applicability of Monte Carlo methods to a wide range of problems in numerical analysis is well known. If one replaces the random sampling procedure, on which a Monte Carlo method is based, by a deterministic selection scheme appropriate to the problem at hand, one arrives at techniques that are collectively called ``quasi-Monte Carlo methods''. These methods have the advantage that one can usually establish effective a priori error bounds for them which are often better than the probabilistic Monte Carlo bounds. Very successful implementations of such methods have been developed for the purposes of numerical integration and approximate solution of integral equations. We refer to [5] for a survey of quasi-Monte Carlo methods.",

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with accuracy properties of simulations of approximate solutions for stochastic dynamic models. Our analysis rests upon a continuity property of invariant distributions and a generalized law of large numbers. We then show that the statistics generated by any sufficiently good numerical approximation are arbitrarily close to the set of expected values of the model's invariant distributions. Also, under a contractivity condition on the dynamics, we establish error bounds. These results are of further interest for the comparative study of stationary solutions and the estimation of structural dynamic models.}

  abstract = {We propose a novel methodology for evaluating the accuracy of numerical solutions to dynamic economic models. It consists in constructing a lower bound on the size of approximation errors. A small lower bound on errors is a necessary condition for accuracy: If a lower error bound is unacceptably large, then the actual approximation errors are even larger, and hence, the approximation is inaccurate. Our lower-bound error analysis is complementary to the conventional upper-error (worst-case) bound analysis, which provides a sufficient condition for accuracy. As an illustration of our methodology, we assess approximation in the first- and second-order perturbation solutions for two stylized models: a neoclassical growth model and a new Keynesian model. The errors are small for the former model but unacceptably large for the latter model under some empirically relevant parameterizations.}

However, the current credit-spread curve is not a sufficient statistic for predicting future out-of-sample credit spreads; predictions can be significantly improved upon by exploiting the information contained in the shape of the riskless yield curve. In the presence of credit-spread and riskless factors, other macroeconomic, marketwide, and firm-specific risk variables do not significantly improve predictions of credit spreads. These results have important implications for credit-spreads modeling as well as for better understanding corporate capital structure and risk management policies.},
